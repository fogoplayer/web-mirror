# web-mirror

I wanted a full screen mirror PWA, so I built one in a couple hours. Note: this was supposed to be a quick hack-together, so there are lots of unnamed commits and very little user-generated comments (though there's so little code that hopefully isn't necessary).

Built using PWAbuilder: https://www.pwabuilder.com/
